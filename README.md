# Cylindrical-manipulater-
A robtotic arm based cylindrical manipulater for vertical and horizontal cartesian movements which able to pick a box and place it on desired position



Introduction
Cylindrical manipulator robots have a cylindrical workspace and consist of linear and rotational movements.

Features vertical linear axis (Z-axis), radial linear axis (R-axis), and rotational axis (Î¸-axis) around the vertical axis.

Structure includes a vertical column mounted on a revolute joint at the base, with an arm extending radially and rotating around the column.

Advantages:

Ability to reach around obstacles within the cylindrical workspace.
Suitable for applications where access to the target object may be obstructed.
Compact footprint due to vertical column and radial arm design.
Cost-effective due to simplicity.
Common Applications:

Industries: assembly, packaging.
Tasks: loading, unloading machines where access to target object may be limited.
Incorporating Vision Control with OpenCV:

Elevates robotic system capabilities.
Enables real-time perception and interaction with the environment.
Facilitates tasks: object recognition, tracking, manipulation.
Enhances autonomy and versatility.
Meets demand for automation in complex environments.
